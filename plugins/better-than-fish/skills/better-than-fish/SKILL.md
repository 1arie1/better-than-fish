# better-than-fish

A skill for agent-driven research notebooks. The user directs; the agent
writes, supersedes, distills, and indexes. The point is to capture the
**delta of understanding** that accumulates over a conversation in a form
that survives into the next one.

The name is the parable: don't hand the user a fish (one good answer that
evaporates with the session). Build the boat (a knowledge base that
compounds across sessions).

## When this skill is in scope

This skill is for **technical research and engineering investigations** where:
- Insights accumulate over time
- Some claims are durable (paper-grounded, source-verified) and others are
  speculative (working hypotheses)
- The corpus grows large enough that an agent can't hold it in context
- The human is the director, not the writer

Out of scope: one-off coding tasks, things with their own ticketing system,
notes meant for human navigation (those need different conventions —
indexing, tags, searchability).

## Where notes live

Notes live in a single project directory configured by the user. The agent
discovers it in this order:

1. `$BTF_NOTES_DIR` env var, if set
2. A `CLAUDE.md` in the current project root that says "notes at: PATH"
3. The agent asks the user once, records the answer in the project's
   `CLAUDE.md`, and uses it from then on

The directory layout is:

```
<notes-dir>/
  CLAUDE.md            <= 80 lines. Project-stable conventions only.
                          No active-investigation content; that lives in
                          journal/. Always loaded.
  durable/             [FACT] — math, paper, source-grounded reality,
                          recorded design patterns. Time-invariant or
                          near-invariant.
  empirical/           [EMP] — repeated empirical claims, version-bound.
                          Things that have been observed multiple times
                          and aren't flukes, but aren't math/paper
                          truths either. Each note carries a "verified
                          against" version stamp.
  journal/YYYY-MM/     [OBS], [HYP] — single events, dated.
                          Append-only stream of investigation entries.
  weekly/YYYY-Www.md   distilled weekly digests
  monthly/YYYY-MM.md   distilled monthly digests
  loose-ends/parked.md  parked explorations with enough context to resume
  sessions.md           chronological index of significant conversation
                          sessions and what they produced. Added per
                          session that moves durable state forward.
  papers/              source corpus (PDFs, papers, etc.)
  <concept>/           top-level directories for tools or concepts that
                          cut across investigations (e.g. lemur/ for
                          analysis tooling). See "Top-level concept
                          directories" below.
```

Subdirectories under `durable/`, `empirical/`, and `journal/` are
organized by topic when the corpus grows beyond ~30 files in one folder.

### The three tiers

The split between `durable/`, `empirical/`, and `journal/` reflects how
likely a claim is to survive over time:

- **`durable/`**: math facts (e.g. McCormick is the convex envelope of
  xy in a box), paper-grounded design (the z3 NLA waterfall), source-
  grounded reality (the `force_phase` API at smt_context.h:1097),
  **recorded design patterns** (an experimental design we tried — the
  pattern itself is durable even if the experiment turned out to be
  inconclusive).
- **`empirical/`**: claims supported by repeated empirical observation.
  "Ramped Gröbner closes more on Lyapunov benchmarks" — true now, not a
  math fact, but consistently observed. Each empirical note is bound to
  a specific code version and may go stale when the code changes.
- **`journal/`**: single observations and hypotheses from one
  investigation session. Some will distill to empirical, some will be
  flukes that fade.

The user's framing: **"Anything empirical is durable but only for that
version."** Promotion across tiers happens via distillation (see
`references/distillation.md`).

### Top-level concept directories

Tools and concepts that cut across multiple investigations may earn
their own top-level directory in the notes (e.g. `lemur/` for analysis
tooling). These hold design docs, prototype code, accumulated artifacts
(small SQLite DBs, etc.) — anything that needs to outlive a particular
worktree or investigation thread.

When a concept directory's content matures (gets implemented in
production, lands in a library), it migrates out, and a thin pointer
note in `durable/` describes its conceptual role.

## Confidence markers — the core discipline

Every claim in a note carries a marker. The marker is a tag at the start of
the relevant paragraph, in square brackets:

- `[FACT]` — math, paper, source-verified, or recorded design pattern.
  Should cite a source (paper section, file:line, commit hash) when
  applicable. Lives in `durable/`. Time-invariant or near-invariant.
- `[EMP]` — empirical claim that has been observed multiple times.
  Carries a "Verified against" version stamp (z3 commit, build, etc.).
  Lives in `empirical/`. Version-bound; may go stale with code changes.
- `[OBS YYYY-MM-DD]` — single empirical observation, dated. Lives in
  `journal/`. Distills to `empirical/` if it survives repetition.
- `[HYP]` — working hypothesis, untested or partially tested. The most
  fragile category. Lives in `journal/` until verified or refuted.
- `[OPEN]` — known unknown. Has a corresponding entry in `loose-ends/`.
- `[SUPERSEDED → path]` — claim was wrong; left as a trail to the corrected
  version, never silently deleted.

The user's framing: **what persists is true.** A `[HYP]` that survives
weeks of work without contradiction earns promotion to `[OBS]`, then to
`[EMP]` once observed across multiple investigations, then potentially
to `[FACT]` if it becomes math/paper/source-grounded. The markers make
this explicit instead of guessed.

See `references/format.md` for full conventions and `references/corrections.md`
for the supersede pattern.

## Triggers

The agent acts on these phrases without further confirmation:

- **"note this"** / **"save this"** — write a journal entry for the current
  finding. Use today's date.
- **"wrong, [correction]"** or **"actually [correction]"** — find the related
  note (grep), supersede it with `[SUPERSEDED → ...]`, write a new note with
  the correct claim, and append a brief "why I was misled" line. This is the
  highest-value action. Never delete the wrong note silently.
- **"park this"** — move the current investigation to `loose-ends/parked.md`
  with the five-field format (Status, Context, Why parked, To resume,
  Effort estimate).
- **"digest"** — read journal entries since the last digest, write the
  weekly or monthly summary. Promote anything that's been referenced
  multiple times to `durable/`.
- **"what do we know about X"** — grep notes first, summarize what's there,
  then answer. Don't re-derive what's already written down.

The user may add project-specific triggers in the project CLAUDE.md.

## Proactive writes (without being told)

The agent commits writes proactively in these situations:

1. **After a substantive finding.** If the user says "we are learning a lot",
   "interesting", or similar markers of insight, propose a journal entry.
   First conversation in a new project: propose every write before
   committing. Once the user's defaults are clear, switch to writing
   directly with a session-end summary of writes.

2. **On corrections.** If the user corrects a claim the agent made
   (in conversation or in notes), supersede immediately. Even if the
   user doesn't say "wrong" explicitly — recognize the correction.

3. **Before context-window pressure.** If the conversation is approaching
   limits or the user is wrapping up, flush the conversation's durable
   findings to `journal/` so they survive the session. Also append a
   `sessions.md` entry summarizing what the session produced and what
   corrections were made — see "Sessions log" below.

4. **When asked about a topic, grep first.** Before answering "what do we
   know about X", read the existing notes. Don't re-explain things the
   user already taught.

## Reading discipline

At the start of any session involving the project:

1. Read `<notes-dir>/CLAUDE.md` for project conventions and triggers.
2. Skim `durable/` index (filenames + descriptions) to understand the
   landscape.
3. Read the most recent weekly digest if it exists — it tells you the
   current state of investigation.
4. Read recent (`< 7 days`) journal entries that may be relevant to the
   current task.

Don't read everything — the system is sized so that this onboarding is
cheap. If the user asks about something specific, grep for that topic in
notes/.

## Distillation (consolidation)

This is the practice that makes the system work. Without it, you accumulate
a write-only journal.

- **Weekly digest** (Friday-ish, or when the user types "digest weekly"):
  read the past week's journal entries, write a 1-page summary in
  `weekly/YYYY-Www.md`. Identify which `[HYP]`s survived, which got
  superseded, which `[OBS]`s are durable patterns vs single-instance
  noise. Move durable ones up the chain.

- **Monthly digest** (first Monday of new month or "digest monthly"):
  read 4 weekly digests, write `monthly/YYYY-MM.md`. Promote anything
  referenced across multiple weeks to `durable/`.

- **Promotion to `durable/`** is the agent's call, but propose it: "I've
  seen X referenced in 3 weekly digests. Propose promoting to durable.
  OK?" — if the user agrees, the note moves with `[FACT]` (or `[OBS]` if
  not source-grounded). Don't promote silently.

See `references/distillation.md` for examples of well-vs-poorly-done digests.

## Loose ends

`loose-ends/parked.md` is a backlog of investigations that were started or
considered but not pursued. Each entry has five fields:

```markdown
## <one-line title>
**Status:** parked YYYY-MM-DD
**Context:** what's the question, what's known so far, why it matters
**Why parked:** what was prioritized instead
**To resume:** concrete next steps an agent can pick up cold
**Effort estimate:** rough wall-time, e.g., "~30 min" or "~half-day"
**References:** links to related notes by filename
```

When the user says "what should I work on next?" or "I have an hour, pick
something" — grep for `Effort estimate.*30 min` (or similar) and propose
the matching items.

## Sessions log

`sessions.md` at the notes-dir root is a curated chronological index of
**significant** conversation sessions. Not a log of every conversation
— add an entry only when the session produced notes, code, or
decisions worth pointing back to.

Each entry has:

- **Date** (header)
- **Session** — the conversation's short name (e.g. set via `/rename`),
  if the host has one. Lets agents and humans correlate the entry with
  the actual conversation log. Backtick-quoted: `\`session-name\``.
- **Theme** — one-line description of what the session was about
- **Key outputs** — list of new/modified notes, prototype code, etc.
- **Critical corrections** — if the user corrected the agent's framing
  during the session, list the corrections (also captured in superseded
  notes). This is high-value content; surfaces when an investigation's
  understanding pivoted.
- **Status** — complete / paused / superseded by later session
- **Next-session pickup candidates** — pointers to `loose-ends/parked.md`
  entries or open questions that came up.

The agent maintains this file. When wrapping up a session that produced
durable content, propose appending an entry; user reviews and approves.

For a new agent in a future session, `sessions.md`'s most recent entry
is the fastest way to know "what's the state of play here?" — faster
than reading the most recent journal entry.

## Anti-patterns

Things that look reasonable but degrade the system:

- **Writing notes that summarize without an interpretation.** "We tried X
  and saw Y" is incomplete. "...and our reading is Z because W" is the
  durable form.
- **Deleting wrong notes instead of superseding them.** The correction
  trail is the highest-value content; don't lose it.
- **Notes about transient state.** PR-1483 status, today's runner load,
  etc. — these belong in PR descriptions or task tools, not the knowledge
  base.
- **Heavy schemas.** YAML frontmatter, mandatory fields, long templates —
  any of these mean fewer notes get written. The marker tags + a date are
  sufficient structure.
- **Reading everything before answering.** Grep specifically. The system
  scales because the agent doesn't need to load the whole corpus.

## Bootstrap

For a new project: run `references/bootstrap.md` walkthrough. The agent
creates the directory structure, draws conventions from the user's first
session, writes a starter `CLAUDE.md` in the notes directory.

## Configuration

| variable | meaning | default |
|---|---|---|
| `BTF_NOTES_DIR` | path to the notes directory | (asks once if unset) |
| `BTF_DIGEST_DAY` | which weekday to remind about weekly digest | Friday |

Both are optional. The skill works with no configuration if the user
points the agent at the directory once.
