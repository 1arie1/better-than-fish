# better-than-fish

A Claude Code skill for **agent-driven research notebooks**. The user
directs; the agent writes, supersedes, distills, and indexes. The
point is to capture the *delta of understanding* that accumulates
across a conversation in a form that survives into the next one.

The name is the parable: don't hand the user a fish (one good answer
that evaporates with the session). Build the boat (a knowledge base
that compounds across sessions).

## What it does

When you're in a long-running technical investigation, this skill
governs how the agent maintains a structured knowledge base — three
tiers of durability, confidence markers, supersede-on-correction
discipline, weekly/monthly distillation, a curated sessions log,
and a parked loose-ends backlog.

The user role is supervisory. Trigger phrases drive specific actions:

- "note this" / "save this" — agent writes a journal entry
- "wrong, X" / "actually X" — agent finds and supersedes the related
  note, records what made the wrong claim plausible
- "park this" — moves current investigation to `loose-ends/parked.md`
  with full resume context
- "digest" — distills the journal into weekly/monthly summary
- "what do we know about X" — agent greps notes first, then answers

## What it isn't

- Not for one-off coding tasks
- Not human-navigable docs (those need different conventions)
- Not auto-magic — the user has to engage the triggers; the agent
  proposes proactive writes early on, switches to direct writes once
  defaults align

## Three tiers

```
durable/      [FACT] math, paper, source-grounded reality, recorded
              design patterns. Time-invariant.
empirical/    [EMP]  repeated empirical claims with version stamps.
              Stable but version-bound.
journal/      [OBS] [HYP] dated single events. Distill to empirical
              if they recur, fade if they're flukes.
```

Plus `loose-ends/parked.md` (backlog), `sessions.md` (curated session
index), and optional top-level concept directories for cross-cutting
tools.

## Install

This repo is a Claude Code **marketplace** with one plugin
(`better-than-fish`). Installation is a two-step dance: add the
marketplace, then install the plugin from it.

### From a local clone

```
/plugin marketplace add /Users/you/certora/skills/better-than-fish
/plugin install better-than-fish@better-than-fish
```

### From a git remote (once pushed)

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/<you>/better-than-fish
/plugin install better-than-fish@better-than-fish
```

The name appears twice: once for the marketplace, once for the plugin
— they happen to share the name in this single-plugin repo.

### Update later

```
/plugin marketplace update better-than-fish
```

### Uninstall

```
/plugin uninstall better-than-fish@better-than-fish
/plugin marketplace remove better-than-fish
```

### Manual symlink (for development of the skill itself)

```sh
ln -s /Users/you/certora/skills/better-than-fish/plugins/better-than-fish/skills/better-than-fish \
      ~/.claude/skills/better-than-fish
```

Bypasses the plugin system; live-edits flow through immediately.
Remove the symlink before using `/plugin install` to avoid collisions.

## Configuration

| variable | meaning | default |
|---|---|---|
| `BTF_NOTES_DIR` | path to the notes directory | (asks once if unset) |
| `BTF_DIGEST_DAY` | weekday to remind about weekly digest | Friday |

Both optional. The skill works with no configuration if the user
points the agent at the directory once; the agent records the choice
in the project's `CLAUDE.md`.

## Bootstrap

For a new project, ask the agent something like:

> Bootstrap better-than-fish notes at `<path>` for this project.

The agent creates the directory structure, writes a starter
`CLAUDE.md`, and proposes initial `durable/` notes for any
project-stable facts that came up in the bootstrap conversation.
Subsequent sessions follow the trigger vocabulary above.

## Contributing

This skill emerged from real research workflow needs. Improvements
that strengthen the **triage** part (when does the agent decide a
finding is worth a note?) or the **distillation** part (when does
something graduate from journal → empirical → durable?) are
especially welcome.
